Elite YouTube

## Problem to Solve:
- Viewers perspective: Public platforms exist too many low quality contents, misinformations, out-dated skills, AI fake news and contents
- Producers perspective: Viewers and followers are larged driven by paid promotions, if not paid, even good contents will not be promoted and profit. Hereby new platforms with good contents always have chance.
- Principle: Everybody like good things, high quality things, everybody is pursuing to be better. Same happens in restaurant food delivery area.
- High-value market complaints: most tech CEOs claims that they themselves together with the kids will not be allowed to watch low quality video contents and misinformation. That is because these platforms are fully driven by view counts, by the mass. But here we have real market demands.
  Where there is high-value people's complaints, there is market.
- Similar apps to reference: Netflix, PrimeVideo, Bilibili, YouTube not really cause it is too complicated for now.
- The potential issue: Netflix, PrimeVideo all have legal copyrights.
